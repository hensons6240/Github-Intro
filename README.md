# Github-Intro
My definition on a few key terms in github based off of "The Coding Trains" Introduction video to Github.<br>
Git - A version control software and the actual application
GitHub - Website or services that uses Git
Repository/Repo - Something like a 'project' that you can attach files to.
Commit - Somewhat like a save button, you accept that changes you made to a file.
